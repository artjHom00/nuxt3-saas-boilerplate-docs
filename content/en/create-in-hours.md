In this article we'll set up everything and create landing page & receive payments from clients.

## Setting up the project

Search for <b>"_*: "</b> in the VS Code through all files to get all the required actions for the website.
Then search for <b>"_**: "</b> (two **) to get non-mandatory actions. 

## Building the landing page
Once you've configured the app and launched it using ```npm run dev```, you can access the website on ```localhost:3000/```
You will see a starting section:
<img src="./start-section.png" class="light-img" width="1280" height="640" alt=""/>


Then, copy the code below into your ```/pages/index.vue``` file, to create a fully functional & selling landing page
